## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ProjactParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the projact data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Tag>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Projact`, which `Person` references. This allows `Projact` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save projact data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Implementation**

### Implemented features
**TagList feature**

The TagList feature allows a user to display all the tags in the tag list currently.

- How is TagList Command executed
    1. The command is passed into `LogicManager`.
    1. `LogicManager` calls parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    1. `ProjactParser` returns `TagListCommand`.
    1. `LogicManager` executes `TagListCommand`, which sets isTagList parameter in `CommandResult` to true.
    1. `MainWindow` detects `CommandResult` isTagList() returns true and hence invokes the showTagList() method.
    
The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagListCommand`. 

![TagListSequenceDiagram](images/TagListSequenceDiagram.png)


- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The feature was implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there would be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the `TagListCommand` would also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.

**TagFind feature**

The TagFind feature allows a user to display all tags which contains at least one of the specified keywords.

1. The command is passed in to `LogicManager`.
2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'tagfind' and the arguments.
4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TagFindCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `TagNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the keywords, and returns a new `TagFindCommand` with the new `TagNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object used as an argument.
5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TagFindCommand`, which calls the updateFilteredTagList method of `Model`. This method takes in a `Predicate<Tag>` and filters the `TagList` by the supplied predicate.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagFindCommand`. 

![TagFindSequenceDiagram](images/TagFindSequenceDiagram.png)

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - In order to make use of the existing codebase while keeping to the principle of accomplishing a task with a single action rather than a series of actions, we decided to find a `Tag` by keywords rather than navigating to a `Tag` by index.

### Future implementation plans
**TagAdd feature**

The TagAdd feature allows a user to add a new tag to the tag list. The tag added will not have any people in it initially.

1. The command is passed into `LogicManager`.
2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'tagadd' and the arguments.
4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TagAddCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `Tag` object, and returns a new `TagAddCommand` with the new `Tag` object used as an argument.
5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TagAddCommand`, which calls the addTag method of `Model`.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagAddCommand`. 

![TagAddSequenceDiagram](images/TagAddSequenceDiagram.png)

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The feature was implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there would be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the TagAddCommand would also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.

**TagEdit feature**

1. The command is passed in to `LogicManager`.
2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'tagedit' and the arguments.
4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TagEditCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `Index` object and a new `EditTagDescriptor`object, and returns a new `TagEditCommand` with those objects used as arguments.
5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TagEditCommand`, which create a new `Tag` object with the edited field and replaces the current `Tag` object at the specified index in `FilteredTagList`.
6. `FilteredTagList` is updated with the edited `Tag` object and will reflect the changes in the `Model`.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagEditCommand`.

![Sequence Diagram of Tag Edit](images/TagEditSequenceDiagram.png)
  
- Why is it implemented that way:
  - The implementation of the TagEdit command is very similar to the Edit command so that we can reuse the previous code.
  - For example, by making the commandWord 'tagedit' instead of 'tag edit', we are able to make use of `ProjectParser` instead of creating a different parser just to identify tag commands.

**TagDelete feature**

The TagDelete feature allows a user to delete a tag permanently. This feature will result in the removal of the tag from the tag list and from any contact with said tag.

How it would be implemented:
1. The command is passed in to `LogicManager`.
2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'tagdelete' and the arguments.
4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TagDeleteCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `Index` object with the parsed user input, and returns a new `TagDeleteCommand` with the new `Index` object used as an argument.
5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TagDeleteCommand`, which retrieves the most updated tag list from the `ModelManager`. From this list, the tag to be deleted is retrieved by its index. Then, the `ModelManager` will go on to remove all instances of the tag.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagDeleteCommand`.

![TagDeleteSequenceDiagram](images/TagDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
 
- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The feature was implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there would be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the `TagDeleteCommand` would also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.

## **Known Issues**

### Projact v1.2

**Tag display auto-refresh issue**

Problem: The tag display does not refresh itself after adding, editing and deleting a tag.

Workaround: Run the `taglist` command again to refresh the display

Technicalities/Explanations: The problem is caused by an ongoing change in Model, which is scheduled to be completed by Projact v1.3.

#### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file
       Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

#### Deletes a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.


#### Saves data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. If the data file is missing, the application will launch a window that is populated with the sample data. User can use the `clear` command to get an empty projact window.
      Expected: Window with sample data

   1. If the data file is corrupted, users should delete the `projact.json` file in data folder. Relaunch the jar file again.
